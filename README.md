# Hi, I'm Berkan 👋🏻  
iOS Developer @ BlindID | Former Architect Turned App Builder

## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me

Hey! I'm Berkan — an iOS developer with an unconventional but deeply connected past in **architecture**. My journey started with a desire to build something of my own. What began as a side curiosity turned into a full-blown passion for building mobile apps.

Coming from architecture, I’ve always been driven by **design-thinking, structure, and user-focused solutions**. That same mindset now fuels my work in mobile development — where design, usability, and system thinking are just as critical.

I've been professionally developing iOS apps since **2020**, and recently I've been diving into **Flutter** to add cross-platform development to my toolkit. I'm always curious, always building, and always learning.

## 🚀 Current Role

At **BlindID**, I'm part of the mobile team, where we recently led a **major migration from UIKit to SwiftUI**. This experience deepened my understanding of:

- Declarative UI programming  
- SwiftUI performance optimization  
- Bridging UIKit & SwiftUI  
- Modernizing legacy codebases with minimal downtime
